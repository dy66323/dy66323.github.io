Hi, this is **Dingyao LIU**'s website.
I am currently a PhD candidate advised by Prof. Shiming Zhang and I am part of the HKU WISE Research Group.

⛵ **Now, I am actively seeking a postdoctoral research position and excited about new collaborative opportunities!**

My research interests mainly focus on:

- **Soft functional materials**, including semiconducting hydrogel, biomaterials, liquid metal, and their practical applications.
- **Organic bioelectronics** based on organic mixed ion conductors (OMIECs), particularly for wearable applications and healthcare monitoring.
- **Brain-mimic Computing**, Neuromorphic computing and hardware implementation.

📌 Feel free to reach out to discuss research collaboration or any other opportunities!

**Dingyao Liu**, Xinyu Tian, Jing Bai, **Shiming Zhang**.

The lack of scalable fabrication methods for high-density, miniaturized stretchable OECT arrays restricts their widespread integration into wearable systems. To address this limitation, we developed a standardized inkjet printing protocol for fabricating intrinsically stretchable OECT arrays with high resolution, reproducibility, and yield. Leveraging a supramolecular adhesion layer to enhance the robustness of the soft semiconductor film under strain, we successfully demonstrated high-uniformity stable stretchable transistor arrays suitable for real-time, on-body sensing and in-sensor computing. This scalable approach marks significant progress toward practical wearable electronic systems capable of direct signal processing at the point of measurement.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83c8efc2-5288-4daf-ab50-fa89be986fce)
