      Organic electrochemical transistors could be used in in-sensor computing and wearable healthcare applications. However, they lack the conformity and stretchability needed to minimize mechanical mismatch between the devices and human body, are challenging to fabricate at a scale with small feature sizes and high density, and require miniaturized readout systems for practical on-body applications. Here we report a wearable in-sensor computing platform based on stretchable organic electrochemical transistor arrays. The platform offers more than 50% stretchability by using an adhesive supramolecular buffer layer during fabrication that improves robustness at interfaces under strain. We fabricate stretchable transistor arrays with feature sizes down to 100‚ÄâŒºm using a high-resolution six-channel inkjet printing system. We also develop a coin-sized data readout system for biosignal acquisition. We show that our coin-sized, smartwatch-compatible electronic module can provide wearable in-sensor edge computing.

      Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs) are critical toward closed-loop diabetes management. The field‚Äôs progress urges next-generation CGMs with enhanced antinoise ability, reliability, and wearability. Here, we propose a coin-sized, fully integrated, and wearable CGM, achieved by holistically synergizing state-of-the-art interdisciplinary technologies of biosensors, minimally invasive tools, and hydrogels. The proposed CGM consists of three major parts: (i) an emerging biochemical signal amplifier, the organic electrochemical transistor (OECT), improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) beyond traditional electrochemical sensors; (ii) a microneedle array to facilitate subcutaneous glucose sampling with minimized pain; and (iii) a soft hydrogel to stabilize the skin-device interface. Compared to conventional CGMs, the OECT-CGM offers a high antinoise ability, tunable sensitivity and resolution, and comfort wearability, enabling personalized glucose sensing for future precision diabetes health care. Last, we discuss how OECT technology can help push the limit of detection of current wearable electrochemical biosensors, especially when operating in complicated conditions.

       Intrinsically stretchable organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are being pursued as the next-generation tissue-like bioelectronic technologies to improve the interfacing with the soft human body. However, the performance of current intrinsically stretchable OECTs is far inferior to their rigid counterparts. In this work, for the first time, the authors report intrinsically stretchable OECTs with overall performance benchmarkable to conventional rigid devices. In particular, oxygen level in the stretchable substrate is revealed to have a significant impact on the on/off ratio. By employing stretchable substrates with low oxygen permeabilities, the on/off ratio is elevated from ‚âà10 to a record-high value of ‚âà104, which is on par with a rigid OECT. The device remained functional after cyclic stretching tests. This work demonstrates that intrinsically stretchable OECTs have the potential to serve as a new building block for emerging soft bioelectronic applications such as electronic skin, soft implantables, and soft neuromorphic computing.

       Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have emerged as a next-generation biosensing technology because of their water-stability, cost-effectiveness, and ability to obtain high sensitivity at low operation voltage (mV). However, a miniaturized readout unit that can wirelessly characterize the overall performance of an OECT is still missing, which hinders the assembling of truly wearable OECT systems for continuous health-monitoring applications. In this work, we present a coin-sized analytical unit for remote and wireless OECT characterization, namely, a personalized electronic reader for electrochemical transistors (PERfECT). It has been verified that PERfECT can measure the transfer, output, hysteresis, and transient behavior of OECTs with resolution and sampling rate on par with the bulky equipment used in laboratories. PERfECT is also capable of characterizing other low-voltage transistors. An integrated board for multiplexed OECT characterizations (32 channels) has also been demonstrated. This work provides a missing building block for developing next-generation OECT-based bioelectronics for digital wearable applications.

    3D transistors have been pursued in bioelectronics to bridge the dimensional gap between 2D transistors and 3D living systems. However, this poses material challenges, as conventional semiconductors are inherently 2D in both architecture and function. In this work, we report 3D semiconductors, integrating hydrogels, organic electronics, and electrochemistry. The 3D semiconductors offer complete 3D bulk modulation up to millimeter-scale thickness, far exceeding the micrometer-scale limitations of current semiconductors. Simultaneously, they offer intrinsic stretchability up to 50% and a modulus of 10‚Äì100 kPa‚Äîsix orders of magnitude lower than conventional GPa-scale semiconductors. We demonstrated those 3D semiconductors provide immediate opportunities to move beyond 2D transistors, enabling 3D brain-inspired transistors, 3D cell-transistor integration, and 3D biohybrid intelligence, which are critical for bridging transistors with living systems

       Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have been increasingly used in wearable and implantable healthcare applications. However, existing OECT-based sensors have shown mixed results when detecting biochemical signals. An integrated sensing method that can exploit the full potential of OECTs in advancing conventional three-electrode electrochemical systems is still lacking. In this work, we present the Electrochemical Transistor Resonance Spectroscopy (ETRS), an integrated sensing concept achieved by synergizing interdisciplinary technologies across electrochemistry, microelectronics, and artificial intelligence. We show that ETRS is validated that can overcome the detection limit of current electrochemical sensors. In ETRS, the stimulating voltage is scanned over a wide frequency range. A resonance frequency can be identified which corresponds to the highest sensitivity. This resonance indicates an optimal synergy is reached between the detecting electrodes and the transistor, pushing the limit of detection (LoD) orders of magnitude lower than the referencing three-electrode electrochemical methods. We also developed a coin-sized ETRS readout system and validated the efficacy of ETRS in pushing the LoD of wearable biosensors and beyond.

       A solar thermoelectric generator (STEG) that generates electricity from sunlight is expected to be a promising technology for harvesting and conversion of clean solar energy. The integration of a phase-change material (PCM) with the STEG even more enables engines to durably generate power in spite of solar radiation flux. However, its photothermal conversion and output electricity is still limited (<15 W/m2) by the PCM‚Äôs deficient thermal management performance, i.e., restricted thermal conductivity and nonuniform heat-transfer behavior under concentrated sunlight radiation. In this study, a biomimetic phase-change composite, with centrosymmetric and a multidirectionally aligned boron nitride network embedded in polyethylene glycol, is tailored for the STEG via a radial ice-template assembly and infiltration strategy, which behaves in a highly and multidirectionally thermoconductive way and enables a rapid transfer of heat flux and uniform temperature distribution with respect to even a spot-like heat source. As a consequence, a powerful STEG is tactfully designed via the integration of this high-thermal-management characteristic and maximum collection of solar beams, for durable and real-environment solar‚Äìthermal‚Äìelectric conversion, with its photothermal energy conversion efficiency of up to 85.1% and a high peak power density of 40.28 W/m2.

       The ideal thermal dissipation materials for flexible electronics should possess high thermal conductivity, excellent mechanical toughness, compliance for poking, bending, twisting, and stretching, and spontaneous self-healing to adapt to the complex application environment. However, creating these materials is challenging due to the intrinsic thermal‚Äìmechanical‚Äìhealing contradictions. Here, we design an elaborate thermally conductive composite, fabricated by an ingenious method of embedding boron nitride nanosheets‚Äìliquid metal (BNNSs‚ÄìLM) binary fillers into a self-healing poly(urea‚Äìurethane) elastomer (PUUE). The synergy of the hybrid structure of binary fillers and PUUE with desirable mechanical properties perfectly balances these mutually exclusive attributes: (1) LM could bridge adjacent BNNSs typically at the stretched state while rigid BNNSs serve as electrical barriers, promoting the formation of synergistic thermal pathways for high thermal conductivity yet good electrical insulation; (2) depending on the liquid feature of LM and intermolecular/interfacial noncovalent bonds, our composite exhibits low modulus, high stretchability, excellent toughness and, most notably, impressive notch-insensitiveness and self-recoverability after large deformation; (3) the dynamic intermolecular/interfacial noncovalent bonds enable the composite to autonomously restore the mechanical properties and thermo-conductive functionality at room temperature. The advanced thermally conductive composite demonstrates potential for applications in thermal interface materials, electronic packaging materials or organic substrates in flexible electronics.
