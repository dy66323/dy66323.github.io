      Organic electrochemical transistors could be used in in-sensor computing and wearable healthcare applications. However, they lack the conformity and stretchability needed to minimize mechanical mismatch between the devices and human body, are challenging to fabricate at a scale with small feature sizes and high density, and require miniaturized readout systems for practical on-body applications. Here we report a wearable in-sensor computing platform based on stretchable organic electrochemical transistor arrays. The platform offers more than 50% stretchability by using an adhesive supramolecular buffer layer during fabrication that improves robustness at interfaces under strain. We fabricate stretchable transistor arrays with feature sizes down to 100‚ÄâŒºm using a high-resolution six-channel inkjet printing system. We also develop a coin-sized data readout system for biosignal acquisition. We show that our coin-sized, smartwatch-compatible electronic module can provide wearable in-sensor edge computing.

      Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs) are critical toward closed-loop diabetes management. The field‚Äôs progress urges next-generation CGMs with enhanced antinoise ability, reliability, and wearability. Here, we propose a coin-sized, fully integrated, and wearable CGM, achieved by holistically synergizing state-of-the-art interdisciplinary technologies of biosensors, minimally invasive tools, and hydrogels. The proposed CGM consists of three major parts: (i) an emerging biochemical signal amplifier, the organic electrochemical transistor (OECT), improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) beyond traditional electrochemical sensors; (ii) a microneedle array to facilitate subcutaneous glucose sampling with minimized pain; and (iii) a soft hydrogel to stabilize the skin-device interface. Compared to conventional CGMs, the OECT-CGM offers a high antinoise ability, tunable sensitivity and resolution, and comfort wearability, enabling personalized glucose sensing for future precision diabetes health care. Last, we discuss how OECT technology can help push the limit of detection of current wearable electrochemical biosensors, especially when operating in complicated conditions.

       Intrinsically stretchable organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are being pursued as the next-generation tissue-like bioelectronic technologies to improve the interfacing with the soft human body. However, the performance of current intrinsically stretchable OECTs is far inferior to their rigid counterparts. In this work, for the first time, the authors report intrinsically stretchable OECTs with overall performance benchmarkable to conventional rigid devices. In particular, oxygen level in the stretchable substrate is revealed to have a significant impact on the on/off ratio. By employing stretchable substrates with low oxygen permeabilities, the on/off ratio is elevated from ‚âà10 to a record-high value of ‚âà104, which is on par with a rigid OECT. The device remained functional after cyclic stretching tests. This work demonstrates that intrinsically stretchable OECTs have the potential to serve as a new building block for emerging soft bioelectronic applications such as electronic skin, soft implantables, and soft neuromorphic computing.
