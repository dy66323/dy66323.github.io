Hi, this is **Dingyao LIU**'s website.
I am currently a PhD candidate in the department of electrical and electronics engineering, advised by [Prof. Shiming Zhang][https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P_cYer0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao]. And I also cooperated with [Prof. Zhongrui Wang][https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ofl3nUsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao] in neuromorphic computing and [Prof. George Malliaras][https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=66BcnF0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao] in bioelectronics.

⛵ **Now, I am actively seeking a research faculty position and excited about new collaborative opportunities!**

My research interests mainly focus on:

- **Soft functional materials**, including semiconducting hydrogel, biomaterials, liquid metal, and their practical applications.
- **Organic bioelectronics** based on organic mixed ion conductors (OMIECs), particularly for wearable applications and healthcare monitoring.
- **Brain-mimic Computing**, Neuromorphic computing and hardware implementation.

📌 Feel free to reach out to discuss research collaboration or any other opportunities!

      Organic electrochemical transistors could be used in in-sensor computing and wearable healthcare applications. However, they lack the conformity and stretchability needed to minimize mechanical mismatch between the devices and human body, are challenging to fabricate at a scale with small feature sizes and high density, and require miniaturized readout systems for practical on-body applications. Here we report a wearable in-sensor computing platform based on stretchable organic electrochemical transistor arrays. The platform offers more than 50% stretchability by using an adhesive supramolecular buffer layer during fabrication that improves robustness at interfaces under strain. We fabricate stretchable transistor arrays with feature sizes down to 100 μm using a high-resolution six-channel inkjet printing system. We also develop a coin-sized data readout system for biosignal acquisition. We show that our coin-sized, smartwatch-compatible electronic module can provide wearable in-sensor edge computing.
