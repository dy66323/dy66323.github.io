      Organic electrochemical transistors could be used in in-sensor computing and wearable healthcare applications. However, they lack the conformity and stretchability needed to minimize mechanical mismatch between the devices and human body, are challenging to fabricate at a scale with small feature sizes and high density, and require miniaturized readout systems for practical on-body applications. Here we report a wearable in-sensor computing platform based on stretchable organic electrochemical transistor arrays. The platform offers more than 50% stretchability by using an adhesive supramolecular buffer layer during fabrication that improves robustness at interfaces under strain. We fabricate stretchable transistor arrays with feature sizes down to 100‚ÄâŒºm using a high-resolution six-channel inkjet printing system. We also develop a coin-sized data readout system for biosignal acquisition. We show that our coin-sized, smartwatch-compatible electronic module can provide wearable in-sensor edge computing.

      Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs) are critical toward closed-loop diabetes management. The field‚Äôs progress urges next-generation CGMs with enhanced antinoise ability, reliability, and wearability. Here, we propose a coin-sized, fully integrated, and wearable CGM, achieved by holistically synergizing state-of-the-art interdisciplinary technologies of biosensors, minimally invasive tools, and hydrogels. The proposed CGM consists of three major parts: (i) an emerging biochemical signal amplifier, the organic electrochemical transistor (OECT), improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) beyond traditional electrochemical sensors; (ii) a microneedle array to facilitate subcutaneous glucose sampling with minimized pain; and (iii) a soft hydrogel to stabilize the skin-device interface. Compared to conventional CGMs, the OECT-CGM offers a high antinoise ability, tunable sensitivity and resolution, and comfort wearability, enabling personalized glucose sensing for future precision diabetes health care. Last, we discuss how OECT technology can help push the limit of detection of current wearable electrochemical biosensors, especially when operating in complicated conditions.

       Intrinsically stretchable organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are being pursued as the next-generation tissue-like bioelectronic technologies to improve the interfacing with the soft human body. However, the performance of current intrinsically stretchable OECTs is far inferior to their rigid counterparts. In this work, for the first time, the authors report intrinsically stretchable OECTs with overall performance benchmarkable to conventional rigid devices. In particular, oxygen level in the stretchable substrate is revealed to have a significant impact on the on/off ratio. By employing stretchable substrates with low oxygen permeabilities, the on/off ratio is elevated from ‚âà10 to a record-high value of ‚âà104, which is on par with a rigid OECT. The device remained functional after cyclic stretching tests. This work demonstrates that intrinsically stretchable OECTs have the potential to serve as a new building block for emerging soft bioelectronic applications such as electronic skin, soft implantables, and soft neuromorphic computing.

       Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have emerged as a next-generation biosensing technology because of their water-stability, cost-effectiveness, and ability to obtain high sensitivity at low operation voltage (mV). However, a miniaturized readout unit that can wirelessly characterize the overall performance of an OECT is still missing, which hinders the assembling of truly wearable OECT systems for continuous health-monitoring applications. In this work, we present a coin-sized analytical unit for remote and wireless OECT characterization, namely, a personalized electronic reader for electrochemical transistors (PERfECT). It has been verified that PERfECT can measure the transfer, output, hysteresis, and transient behavior of OECTs with resolution and sampling rate on par with the bulky equipment used in laboratories. PERfECT is also capable of characterizing other low-voltage transistors. An integrated board for multiplexed OECT characterizations (32 channels) has also been demonstrated. This work provides a missing building block for developing next-generation OECT-based bioelectronics for digital wearable applications.

    In recent years, 3D transistors have been pursued to extend Moore's Law. They are also highly desired in the field of bioelectronics to bridge the dimensional gap between 2D transistors and 3D living systems. However, this presents material challenges, as conventional semiconductors are inherently 2D in both architecture and modulation. Breaking the dimensional limits of transistors requires 3D semiconductors that integrate inherently conflicting properties, such as 3D architectures and 3D modulation. Furthermore, applications at the soft biological interface demand semiconductors with bio-level modulus and     stretchability. Such a semiconductor remains missing. In this work: i) We present a new material concept‚Äîthe 3D semiconductor‚Äîachieved by integrating hydrogels, semiconductors, and electrochemistry. ii) These 3D hydrogel semiconductors achieve 3D bulk-modulation at millimeter-scale thicknesses, far surpassing the microscale limitations of current semiconductors. iii) Using the 3D semiconductor, we have, for the first time, created 3D transistors and 3D brain-inspired neuroelectronic circuits. These devices feature low modulus and high stretchability, bridging the long-standing gap between existing transistors and living systems. Our work addresses critical technological challenges in pursuing 3D transistors, enabling the creation of bioelectronic devices that can better interface with living systems. This approach has the potential to serve as a universal method for systematically enhancing the functionality of existing semiconductor devices while being broadly applicable to other fields. The methodology presented here provides a valuable reference not only for the semiconductor community but also for researchers across interdisciplinary domains such as bioelectronics, materials science, and neuroscience.

       Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have been increasingly used in wearable and implantable healthcare applications. However, existing OECT-based sensors have shown mixed results when detecting biochemical signals. An integrated sensing method that can exploit the full potential of OECTs in advancing conventional three-electrode electrochemical systems is still lacking. In this work, we present the Electrochemical Transistor Resonance Spectroscopy (ETRS), an integrated sensing concept achieved by synergizing interdisciplinary technologies across electrochemistry, microelectronics, and artificial intelligence. We show that ETRS is validated that can overcome the detection limit of current electrochemical sensors. In ETRS, the stimulating voltage is scanned over a wide frequency range. A resonance frequency can be identified which corresponds to the highest sensitivity. This resonance indicates an optimal synergy is reached between the detecting electrodes and the transistor, pushing the limit of detection (LoD) orders of magnitude lower than the referencing three-electrode electrochemical methods. We also developed a coin-sized ETRS readout system and validated the efficacy of ETRS in pushing the LoD of wearable biosensors and beyond.
